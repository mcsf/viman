Viman is a very simple ncurses organizer for your videos with Vim-like
keybindings. You can add new videos by browsing your Home directory,
list them by year or title or by whether they are marked as watched, and
play them through your video player. This an old toy project; it has
some bugs and could do a lot of other useful things.
